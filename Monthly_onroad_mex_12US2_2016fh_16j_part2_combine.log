     Missing environment variable EXECUTION_ID
      
     Program M3XTRACT to extract selected variables from a
     GRIDDED, BOUNDARY, CUSTOM, or SPARSE MATRIX Models-3 file
     for a specified time period, optionally rename them, and
     write them to another such file.  You may select either
     to extract all layers, to extract a single selected layer,
     or to extract a selected subrange of the layers.
      
     You need to have set environment variables for the input
     and output file logical names.  You will be asked to select
     the set of variables to be extracted, and the time period to
     extract them for.
      
     USAGE:  m3xtract [INFILE OUTFILE]
     (and then answer the prompts).

     Missing environment variable EXECUTION_ID
      
     Program M3XTRACT to extract selected variables from a
     GRIDDED, BOUNDARY, CUSTOM, or SPARSE MATRIX Models-3 file
     for a specified time period, optionally rename them, and
     write them to another such file.  You may select either
     to extract all layers, to extract a single selected layer,
     or to extract a selected subrange of the layers.
      
     You need to have set environment variables for the input
     and output file logical names.  You will be asked to select
     the set of variables to be extracted, and the time period to
     extract them for.
      
     USAGE:  m3xtract [INFILE OUTFILE]
     (and then answer the prompts).

     Missing environment variable EXECUTION_ID
      
     Program M3XTRACT to extract selected variables from a
     GRIDDED, BOUNDARY, CUSTOM, or SPARSE MATRIX Models-3 file
     for a specified time period, optionally rename them, and
     write them to another such file.  You may select either
     to extract all layers, to extract a single selected layer,
     or to extract a selected subrange of the layers.
      
     You need to have set environment variables for the input
     and output file logical names.  You will be asked to select
     the set of variables to be extracted, and the time period to
     extract them for.
      
     USAGE:  m3xtract [INFILE OUTFILE]
     (and then answer the prompts).

     Missing environment variable EXECUTION_ID
      
     Program M3XTRACT to extract selected variables from a
     GRIDDED, BOUNDARY, CUSTOM, or SPARSE MATRIX Models-3 file
     for a specified time period, optionally rename them, and
     write them to another such file.  You may select either
     to extract all layers, to extract a single selected layer,
     or to extract a selected subrange of the layers.
      
     You need to have set environment variables for the input
     and output file logical names.  You will be asked to select
     the set of variables to be extracted, and the time period to
     extract them for.
      
     USAGE:  m3xtract [INFILE OUTFILE]
     (and then answer the prompts).

     Missing environment variable EXECUTION_ID
      
     Program M3XTRACT to extract selected variables from a
     GRIDDED, BOUNDARY, CUSTOM, or SPARSE MATRIX Models-3 file
     for a specified time period, optionally rename them, and
     write them to another such file.  You may select either
     to extract all layers, to extract a single selected layer,
     or to extract a selected subrange of the layers.
      
     You need to have set environment variables for the input
     and output file logical names.  You will be asked to select
     the set of variables to be extracted, and the time period to
     extract them for.
      
     USAGE:  m3xtract [INFILE OUTFILE]
     (and then answer the prompts).

     Missing environment variable EXECUTION_ID
      
     Program M3XTRACT to extract selected variables from a
     GRIDDED, BOUNDARY, CUSTOM, or SPARSE MATRIX Models-3 file
     for a specified time period, optionally rename them, and
     write them to another such file.  You may select either
     to extract all layers, to extract a single selected layer,
     or to extract a selected subrange of the layers.
      
     You need to have set environment variables for the input
     and output file logical names.  You will be asked to select
     the set of variables to be extracted, and the time period to
     extract them for.
      
     USAGE:  m3xtract [INFILE OUTFILE]
     (and then answer the prompts).

     Missing environment variable EXECUTION_ID
      
     Program M3XTRACT to extract selected variables from a
     GRIDDED, BOUNDARY, CUSTOM, or SPARSE MATRIX Models-3 file
     for a specified time period, optionally rename them, and
     write them to another such file.  You may select either
     to extract all layers, to extract a single selected layer,
     or to extract a selected subrange of the layers.
      
     You need to have set environment variables for the input
     and output file logical names.  You will be asked to select
     the set of variables to be extracted, and the time period to
     extract them for.
      
     USAGE:  m3xtract [INFILE OUTFILE]
     (and then answer the prompts).

     Missing environment variable EXECUTION_ID
      
     Program M3XTRACT to extract selected variables from a
     GRIDDED, BOUNDARY, CUSTOM, or SPARSE MATRIX Models-3 file
     for a specified time period, optionally rename them, and
     write them to another such file.  You may select either
     to extract all layers, to extract a single selected layer,
     or to extract a selected subrange of the layers.
      
     You need to have set environment variables for the input
     and output file logical names.  You will be asked to select
     the set of variables to be extracted, and the time period to
     extract them for.
      
     USAGE:  m3xtract [INFILE OUTFILE]
     (and then answer the prompts).

     Missing environment variable EXECUTION_ID
      
     Program M3XTRACT to extract selected variables from a
     GRIDDED, BOUNDARY, CUSTOM, or SPARSE MATRIX Models-3 file
     for a specified time period, optionally rename them, and
     write them to another such file.  You may select either
     to extract all layers, to extract a single selected layer,
     or to extract a selected subrange of the layers.
      
     You need to have set environment variables for the input
     and output file logical names.  You will be asked to select
     the set of variables to be extracted, and the time period to
     extract them for.
      
     USAGE:  m3xtract [INFILE OUTFILE]
     (and then answer the prompts).

     Missing environment variable EXECUTION_ID
      
     Program M3XTRACT to extract selected variables from a
     GRIDDED, BOUNDARY, CUSTOM, or SPARSE MATRIX Models-3 file
     for a specified time period, optionally rename them, and
     write them to another such file.  You may select either
     to extract all layers, to extract a single selected layer,
     or to extract a selected subrange of the layers.
      
     You need to have set environment variables for the input
     and output file logical names.  You will be asked to select
     the set of variables to be extracted, and the time period to
     extract them for.
      
     USAGE:  m3xtract [INFILE OUTFILE]
     (and then answer the prompts).

     Missing environment variable EXECUTION_ID
      
     Program M3XTRACT to extract selected variables from a
     GRIDDED, BOUNDARY, CUSTOM, or SPARSE MATRIX Models-3 file
     for a specified time period, optionally rename them, and
     write them to another such file.  You may select either
     to extract all layers, to extract a single selected layer,
     or to extract a selected subrange of the layers.
      
     You need to have set environment variables for the input
     and output file logical names.  You will be asked to select
     the set of variables to be extracted, and the time period to
     extract them for.
      
     USAGE:  m3xtract [INFILE OUTFILE]
     (and then answer the prompts).

     Missing environment variable EXECUTION_ID
      
     Program M3XTRACT to extract selected variables from a
     GRIDDED, BOUNDARY, CUSTOM, or SPARSE MATRIX Models-3 file
     for a specified time period, optionally rename them, and
     write them to another such file.  You may select either
     to extract all layers, to extract a single selected layer,
     or to extract a selected subrange of the layers.
      
     You need to have set environment variables for the input
     and output file logical names.  You will be asked to select
     the set of variables to be extracted, and the time period to
     extract them for.
      
     USAGE:  m3xtract [INFILE OUTFILE]
     (and then answer the prompts).

     Missing environment variable EXECUTION_ID
      
     Program M3XTRACT to extract selected variables from a
     GRIDDED, BOUNDARY, CUSTOM, or SPARSE MATRIX Models-3 file
     for a specified time period, optionally rename them, and
     write them to another such file.  You may select either
     to extract all layers, to extract a single selected layer,
     or to extract a selected subrange of the layers.
      
     You need to have set environment variables for the input
     and output file logical names.  You will be asked to select
     the set of variables to be extracted, and the time period to
     extract them for.
      
     USAGE:  m3xtract [INFILE OUTFILE]
     (and then answer the prompts).

     Missing environment variable EXECUTION_ID
      
     Program M3XTRACT to extract selected variables from a
     GRIDDED, BOUNDARY, CUSTOM, or SPARSE MATRIX Models-3 file
     for a specified time period, optionally rename them, and
     write them to another such file.  You may select either
     to extract all layers, to extract a single selected layer,
     or to extract a selected subrange of the layers.
      
     You need to have set environment variables for the input
     and output file logical names.  You will be asked to select
     the set of variables to be extracted, and the time period to
     extract them for.
      
     USAGE:  m3xtract [INFILE OUTFILE]
     (and then answer the prompts).

     Missing environment variable EXECUTION_ID
      
     Program M3XTRACT to extract selected variables from a
     GRIDDED, BOUNDARY, CUSTOM, or SPARSE MATRIX Models-3 file
     for a specified time period, optionally rename them, and
     write them to another such file.  You may select either
     to extract all layers, to extract a single selected layer,
     or to extract a selected subrange of the layers.
      
     You need to have set environment variables for the input
     and output file logical names.  You will be asked to select
     the set of variables to be extracted, and the time period to
     extract them for.
      
     USAGE:  m3xtract [INFILE OUTFILE]
     (and then answer the prompts).

     Missing environment variable EXECUTION_ID
      
     Program M3XTRACT to extract selected variables from a
     GRIDDED, BOUNDARY, CUSTOM, or SPARSE MATRIX Models-3 file
     for a specified time period, optionally rename them, and
     write them to another such file.  You may select either
     to extract all layers, to extract a single selected layer,
     or to extract a selected subrange of the layers.
      
     You need to have set environment variables for the input
     and output file logical names.  You will be asked to select
     the set of variables to be extracted, and the time period to
     extract them for.
      
     USAGE:  m3xtract [INFILE OUTFILE]
     (and then answer the prompts).

     Missing environment variable EXECUTION_ID
      
     Program M3XTRACT to extract selected variables from a
     GRIDDED, BOUNDARY, CUSTOM, or SPARSE MATRIX Models-3 file
     for a specified time period, optionally rename them, and
     write them to another such file.  You may select either
     to extract all layers, to extract a single selected layer,
     or to extract a selected subrange of the layers.
      
     You need to have set environment variables for the input
     and output file logical names.  You will be asked to select
     the set of variables to be extracted, and the time period to
     extract them for.
      
     USAGE:  m3xtract [INFILE OUTFILE]
     (and then answer the prompts).

     Missing environment variable EXECUTION_ID
      
     Program M3XTRACT to extract selected variables from a
     GRIDDED, BOUNDARY, CUSTOM, or SPARSE MATRIX Models-3 file
     for a specified time period, optionally rename them, and
     write them to another such file.  You may select either
     to extract all layers, to extract a single selected layer,
     or to extract a selected subrange of the layers.
      
     You need to have set environment variables for the input
     and output file logical names.  You will be asked to select
     the set of variables to be extracted, and the time period to
     extract them for.
      
     USAGE:  m3xtract [INFILE OUTFILE]
     (and then answer the prompts).

     Missing environment variable EXECUTION_ID
      
     Program M3XTRACT to extract selected variables from a
     GRIDDED, BOUNDARY, CUSTOM, or SPARSE MATRIX Models-3 file
     for a specified time period, optionally rename them, and
     write them to another such file.  You may select either
     to extract all layers, to extract a single selected layer,
     or to extract a selected subrange of the layers.
      
     You need to have set environment variables for the input
     and output file logical names.  You will be asked to select
     the set of variables to be extracted, and the time period to
     extract them for.
      
     USAGE:  m3xtract [INFILE OUTFILE]
     (and then answer the prompts).

     Missing environment variable EXECUTION_ID
      
     Program M3XTRACT to extract selected variables from a
     GRIDDED, BOUNDARY, CUSTOM, or SPARSE MATRIX Models-3 file
     for a specified time period, optionally rename them, and
     write them to another such file.  You may select either
     to extract all layers, to extract a single selected layer,
     or to extract a selected subrange of the layers.
      
     You need to have set environment variables for the input
     and output file logical names.  You will be asked to select
     the set of variables to be extracted, and the time period to
     extract them for.
      
     USAGE:  m3xtract [INFILE OUTFILE]
     (and then answer the prompts).

     Missing environment variable EXECUTION_ID
      
     Program M3XTRACT to extract selected variables from a
     GRIDDED, BOUNDARY, CUSTOM, or SPARSE MATRIX Models-3 file
     for a specified time period, optionally rename them, and
     write them to another such file.  You may select either
     to extract all layers, to extract a single selected layer,
     or to extract a selected subrange of the layers.
      
     You need to have set environment variables for the input
     and output file logical names.  You will be asked to select
     the set of variables to be extracted, and the time period to
     extract them for.
      
     USAGE:  m3xtract [INFILE OUTFILE]
     (and then answer the prompts).

     Missing environment variable EXECUTION_ID
      
     Program M3XTRACT to extract selected variables from a
     GRIDDED, BOUNDARY, CUSTOM, or SPARSE MATRIX Models-3 file
     for a specified time period, optionally rename them, and
     write them to another such file.  You may select either
     to extract all layers, to extract a single selected layer,
     or to extract a selected subrange of the layers.
      
     You need to have set environment variables for the input
     and output file logical names.  You will be asked to select
     the set of variables to be extracted, and the time period to
     extract them for.
      
     USAGE:  m3xtract [INFILE OUTFILE]
     (and then answer the prompts).

     Missing environment variable EXECUTION_ID
      
     Program M3XTRACT to extract selected variables from a
     GRIDDED, BOUNDARY, CUSTOM, or SPARSE MATRIX Models-3 file
     for a specified time period, optionally rename them, and
     write them to another such file.  You may select either
     to extract all layers, to extract a single selected layer,
     or to extract a selected subrange of the layers.
      
     You need to have set environment variables for the input
     and output file logical names.  You will be asked to select
     the set of variables to be extracted, and the time period to
     extract them for.
      
     USAGE:  m3xtract [INFILE OUTFILE]
     (and then answer the prompts).

     Missing environment variable EXECUTION_ID
      
     Program M3XTRACT to extract selected variables from a
     GRIDDED, BOUNDARY, CUSTOM, or SPARSE MATRIX Models-3 file
     for a specified time period, optionally rename them, and
     write them to another such file.  You may select either
     to extract all layers, to extract a single selected layer,
     or to extract a selected subrange of the layers.
      
     You need to have set environment variables for the input
     and output file logical names.  You will be asked to select
     the set of variables to be extracted, and the time period to
     extract them for.
      
     USAGE:  m3xtract [INFILE OUTFILE]
     (and then answer the prompts).

     Missing environment variable EXECUTION_ID
      
     Program M3XTRACT to extract selected variables from a
     GRIDDED, BOUNDARY, CUSTOM, or SPARSE MATRIX Models-3 file
     for a specified time period, optionally rename them, and
     write them to another such file.  You may select either
     to extract all layers, to extract a single selected layer,
     or to extract a selected subrange of the layers.
      
     You need to have set environment variables for the input
     and output file logical names.  You will be asked to select
     the set of variables to be extracted, and the time period to
     extract them for.
      
     USAGE:  m3xtract [INFILE OUTFILE]
     (and then answer the prompts).

     Missing environment variable EXECUTION_ID
      
     Program M3XTRACT to extract selected variables from a
     GRIDDED, BOUNDARY, CUSTOM, or SPARSE MATRIX Models-3 file
     for a specified time period, optionally rename them, and
     write them to another such file.  You may select either
     to extract all layers, to extract a single selected layer,
     or to extract a selected subrange of the layers.
      
     You need to have set environment variables for the input
     and output file logical names.  You will be asked to select
     the set of variables to be extracted, and the time period to
     extract them for.
      
     USAGE:  m3xtract [INFILE OUTFILE]
     (and then answer the prompts).

     Missing environment variable EXECUTION_ID
      
     Program M3XTRACT to extract selected variables from a
     GRIDDED, BOUNDARY, CUSTOM, or SPARSE MATRIX Models-3 file
     for a specified time period, optionally rename them, and
     write them to another such file.  You may select either
     to extract all layers, to extract a single selected layer,
     or to extract a selected subrange of the layers.
      
     You need to have set environment variables for the input
     and output file logical names.  You will be asked to select
     the set of variables to be extracted, and the time period to
     extract them for.
      
     USAGE:  m3xtract [INFILE OUTFILE]
     (and then answer the prompts).

     Missing environment variable EXECUTION_ID
      
     Program M3XTRACT to extract selected variables from a
     GRIDDED, BOUNDARY, CUSTOM, or SPARSE MATRIX Models-3 file
     for a specified time period, optionally rename them, and
     write them to another such file.  You may select either
     to extract all layers, to extract a single selected layer,
     or to extract a selected subrange of the layers.
      
     You need to have set environment variables for the input
     and output file logical names.  You will be asked to select
     the set of variables to be extracted, and the time period to
     extract them for.
      
     USAGE:  m3xtract [INFILE OUTFILE]
     (and then answer the prompts).

     Missing environment variable EXECUTION_ID
      
     Program M3XTRACT to extract selected variables from a
     GRIDDED, BOUNDARY, CUSTOM, or SPARSE MATRIX Models-3 file
     for a specified time period, optionally rename them, and
     write them to another such file.  You may select either
     to extract all layers, to extract a single selected layer,
     or to extract a selected subrange of the layers.
      
     You need to have set environment variables for the input
     and output file logical names.  You will be asked to select
     the set of variables to be extracted, and the time period to
     extract them for.
      
     USAGE:  m3xtract [INFILE OUTFILE]
     (and then answer the prompts).

     Missing environment variable EXECUTION_ID
      
     Program M3XTRACT to extract selected variables from a
     GRIDDED, BOUNDARY, CUSTOM, or SPARSE MATRIX Models-3 file
     for a specified time period, optionally rename them, and
     write them to another such file.  You may select either
     to extract all layers, to extract a single selected layer,
     or to extract a selected subrange of the layers.
      
     You need to have set environment variables for the input
     and output file logical names.  You will be asked to select
     the set of variables to be extracted, and the time period to
     extract them for.
      
     USAGE:  m3xtract [INFILE OUTFILE]
     (and then answer the prompts).

     Missing environment variable EXECUTION_ID
      
     Program M3XTRACT to extract selected variables from a
     GRIDDED, BOUNDARY, CUSTOM, or SPARSE MATRIX Models-3 file
     for a specified time period, optionally rename them, and
     write them to another such file.  You may select either
     to extract all layers, to extract a single selected layer,
     or to extract a selected subrange of the layers.
      
     You need to have set environment variables for the input
     and output file logical names.  You will be asked to select
     the set of variables to be extracted, and the time period to
     extract them for.
      
     USAGE:  m3xtract [INFILE OUTFILE]
     (and then answer the prompts).
